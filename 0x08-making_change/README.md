A greedy algorithm is a simple approach to problem-solving where you make the best choice at each step, hoping to find the optimal solution. It's like making decisions without considering the future consequences. While often efficient, it's important to note that greedy algorithms don't always guarantee the optimal solution.

Key Characteristics:

Makes locally optimal choices at each step.
Does not reconsider previous choices.
Often fast and efficient.
Not always guaranteed to find the global optimum.
When to Use Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithms are suitable for problems with the following characteristics:

Optimal substructure: The optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.
Greedy choice property: Making the locally optimal choice at each step leads to a globally optimal solution.
