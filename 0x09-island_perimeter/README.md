To find the island's perimeter, you would:

1. **Identify Land Cells:** Traverse the grid and locate all the land cells.
2. **Count Exposed Edges:** For each land cell, check its four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). For each edge that borders water or is on the grid's edge, you add to the perimeter count.
3. **Sum Up:** The total number of exposed edges gives you the perimeter of the island.

In brief, the "Island Perimeter" problem requires determining how many total edges of land cells are exposed to water or edges of the grid.
